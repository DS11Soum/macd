## Overview

Moving average convergence/divergence is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price.

* The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period EMA of the MACD line.
* MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the norm.
* MACD triggers technical signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (to buy) or falls below it (to sell).
* MACD can help gauge whether a security is overbought or oversold, alerting traders to the strength of a directional move, and warning of a potential price reversal.
* MACD can also alert investors to bullish/bearish divergences (e.g., when a new high in price is not confirmed by a new high in MACD, and vice versa), suggesting a potential failure and reversal.
* After a signal line crossover, it is recommended to wait for three or four days to confirm that it is not a false move.

## MACD Formula

MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA

## Trading signals from MACD

* MACD crossing above zero is considered bullish, while crossing below zero is bearish. Secondly, when MACD turns up from below zero it is considered bullish. When it turns down from above zero it is considered bearish.
* When the MACD line crosses from below to above the signal line, the indicator is considered bullish. The further below the zero line the stronger the signal.
* When the MACD line crosses from above to below the signal line, the indicator is considered bearish. The further above the zero line the stronger the signal.
* During trading ranges the MACD will whipsaw, with the fast line crossing back and forth across the signal line. Users of the MACD generally avoid trading in this situation or close positions to reduce volatility within the portfolio.
* Divergence between the MACD and the price action is a stronger signal when it confirms the crossover signals.

## Overview

Moving average convergence/divergence is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price.

* The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period EMA of the MACD line.
* MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the norm.
* MACD triggers technical signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (to buy) or falls below it (to sell).
* MACD can help gauge whether a security is overbought or oversold, alerting traders to the strength of a directional move, and warning of a potential price reversal.
* MACD can also alert investors to bullish/bearish divergences (e.g., when a new high in price is not confirmed by a new high in MACD, and vice versa), suggesting a potential failure and reversal.
* After a signal line crossover, it is recommended to wait for three or four days to confirm that it is not a false move.

## MACD Formula

MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
